## Description 📄

I have developed an effective note-taking program that enables users to easily store and access their notes. In order to receive, post, and delete data from a dynamically updated JSON file, this application uses an Express.js backend, which is at the heart of its functionality. In order to ensure effective communication between the user interface and the server, the application's frontend and backend are securely connected. Users of this cutting-edge system may take notes with ease and clarity, increasing their productivity and organizational skills.
